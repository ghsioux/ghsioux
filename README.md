Welcome to my GitHub profile, mi casa es tu casa  ðŸ‘»
- ðŸ‘¾ I'm currently working as a Solutions Engineer at GitHub, my goal is to help developers get the most out of the platform;
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cloud & DevSecOps technologies, automation, decentralized networks and information security;
- ðŸª¶ I also (try to) write [blog posts](https://ghsioux.github.io/) sometimes;
- ðŸŒ± During my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities, meditation, riding at night through the ðŸŒƒ

Time to share code and spread ðŸ’œ bon voyage!
