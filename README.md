👋 Hi ninjas, I’m @ghsioux
</br>

Welcome to my GitHub profile, mi casa es tu casa  👻
- 👾 I'm currently working as a Solutions Engineer at GitHub, my goal is to help developers get the most out of the platform;
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud & DevSecOps technologies, automation, decentralized networks and information security;
- 🪶 I also (try to) write [blog posts](https://ghsioux.github.io/) sometimes;
- 🌱 During my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities, meditation, riding at night through the 🌃

Time to share code and spread 💜 bon voyage!
