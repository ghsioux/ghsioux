Hi, Iâ€™m [@ghsioux](https://github.com/ghsioux). ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently a Solutions Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com), helping developers unlock the full potential of the platform. In parallel, I am also the founder of [pard0x](https://pard0x.com), a venture focused on innovative cloud solutions.

Before joining GitHub, I worked in **mobile security R&D** at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr) and as a consultant at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com). These experiences have fueled my passion for **DevSecOps**, **automation**, **AI** and **decentralized networks**.  

When Iâ€™m not working, I like practicing zazen, exploring the outdoors and gardening - maybe that's why I like the green ðŸŸ© so much.  

Letâ€™s code, innovate, and share knowledge together. Bon voyage! ðŸš€
